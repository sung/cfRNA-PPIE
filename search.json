    "text": "Preeclampsia\nPreeclampsia is a serious pregnancy condition characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine after 20 weeks of gestation.\nIt affects around 5‚Äì8% of pregnancies and can cause serious health problems for both mother and baby.\nKey facts:\n\nOften associated with abnormal placental development and blood flow.\n\nMay cause symptoms such as headaches, swelling, or visual changes.\n\nIn severe cases, it can lead to seizures, organ failure, or stillbirth.\n\nThe only definitive cure is delivery of the baby and placenta.\n\nEarly detection is therefore essential ‚Äî and one goal of cfRNA biomarker research is to identify high-risk pregnancies before symptoms appear."
