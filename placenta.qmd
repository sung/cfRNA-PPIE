## What is the Placenta?

The **placenta** is a temporary organ that develops during pregnancy.  
It connects the mother and baby, supplying oxygen and nutrients to the fetus and removing waste products.  
Beyond being a nutrient bridge, the placenta also plays critical roles in:

- Hormone production (e.g. hCG, progesterone, leptin)
- Immune protection of the fetus
- Regulation of fetal growth and development

When the placenta does not form or function properly, it can lead to a range of **pregnancy complications**.


## Preeclampsia

**Preeclampsia** is a serious pregnancy condition characterized by **high blood pressure** and **protein in the urine** after 20 weeks of gestation.  
It affects around 5–8% of pregnancies and can cause serious health problems for both mother and baby.

**Key facts:**

- Often associated with abnormal placental development and blood flow.  
- May cause symptoms such as headaches, swelling, or visual changes.  
- In severe cases, it can lead to **seizures**, **organ failure**, or **stillbirth**.  
- The only definitive cure is **delivery of the baby and placenta**.

Early detection is therefore essential — and one goal of cfRNA biomarker research is to identify high-risk pregnancies **before symptoms appear**.


## Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR)

**Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR)** occurs when a baby is smaller than expected for gestational age due to inadequate nutrient or oxygen supply from the placenta.

**Why it matters:**

- FGR increases the risk of stillbirth and long-term developmental issues.  
- It often overlaps with preeclampsia and other placental dysfunctions.  
- Early identification allows closer monitoring and timely delivery when necessary.


## Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)

**Gestational diabetes** is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy.  
It happens when the body cannot produce enough insulin to meet the increased demands of pregnancy.

**Key points:**

- Usually occurs in the second or third trimester.  
- Can cause babies to grow too large (macrosomia), leading to birth complications.  
- May increase the risk of preeclampsia and cesarean delivery.  
- Women with GDM are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life.

Although GDM is primarily a metabolic disorder, it also affects placental function — highlighting how **maternal metabolism and placenta health are closely linked**.


## Why Study Cell-free RNAs?

Cell-free RNAs (cfRNAs) are fragments of RNA released from cells into the blood.  
During pregnancy, some cfRNAs originate from the **placenta** and can reflect how it is functioning.

By studying cfRNAs, we can:

- Detect early signs of placental stress or dysfunction.  
- Predict complications before clinical symptoms appear.  
- Potentially guide personalized monitoring and interventions.

This line of research brings us closer to **non-invasive prediction tools** that could save lives and improve outcomes for mothers and babies.
