subtitle: "Understanding Placenta-related Pregnancy Complications through Cell-free RNA Research"

# Welcome to My PPIE Activity Website
This site is part of my preparation for the **NIHR Postdoctoral Fellowship** application.
My proposed research aims to improve pregnancy outcomes by identifying **cell-free RNA (cfRNA) biomarkers** in maternal blood that can predict **placenta-related complications**, such as **preeclampsia** and **fetal growth restriction**.

## Understanding Pregnancy Health Through Research

Pregnancy is an incredible journey, but for some families, it can come with serious complications that affect both mother and baby.  
My research focuses on understanding how **molecules called cell-free RNAs (cfRNAs)** circulating in the mother's blood can help us **predict pregnancy complications early**, before symptoms appear.

I recently published our latest findings in *Nature Communications (2025)*:  
[**"Raised Leptin and Pappalysin2 cell-free RNAs are the hallmarks of pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia with fetal growth restriction."**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61931-7)

This fellowship project aims to build upon that work and develop a cfRNA-based tool to identify high-risk pregnancies.

## Why Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) Matters

Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) ensures that research is **relevant, transparent, and meaningful** to the people it ultimately aims to help. 

Through PPIE activities, members of the public can:

- Share **their perspectives** on the importance and acceptability of the research.
- Help **refine study design** and priorities.
- Improve **communication** of scientific findings in plain language.
- Ensure that research outcomes are **accessible and useful** to families and clinicians.

Your feedback will help shape how we design and communicate this research ‚Äî from what questions we ask to how we share results.

All responses are anonymous and confidential.

Your voices and experiences are essential:

- Reflects **real needs and priorities** of expectant families.
- Uses **language and outcomes** that are understandable and meaningful.
- Respects the **values and concerns** of those directly affected by pregnancy complications.
- Leads to **better communication** between researchers, clinicians, and families.
